![popup](icon.png)

## Description

After numerous complaints, DuckDuckGo still haven't added this feature so I took matters into my own hands and coded it.
This extension simply displays the date, comments, and upvote information of Reddit pages listed in [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) search results.
